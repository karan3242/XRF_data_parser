# üî¨ XRF Data Parsing Tool for OLYMPUS VANTA pXRF Chemistry Datasets

This Shiny application is designed to **streamline the analysis of XRF datasets** exported from the **OLYMPUS VANTA pXRF** device using the Geo Chem method. It simplifies complex raw data into a clean, normalized, and insightful format for geochemical analysis.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements & Data Setup

## Prerequisites

![](https://www.portaspecs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sized_m-series_2_1024x1024.jpg)

To use this application, you must have the following:
* **OLYMPUS VANTA pXRF device** for data acquisition.
* Data must be exported using the **Geo Chem export method**.

## Data Preparation

Ensure your CSV export strictly adheres to the **Geo Chem format**. Specifically:
* The **Item Notes** column must be consistently labeled as `LAB_ID`.
* The `LAB_ID` values should contain both letters and numbers (e.g., `S-101`, `A-2B`) for string-value compatibility and optimal parsing.

# ‚ú® Features & Workflow

This tool is specifically tailored to parse OLYMPUS VANTA pXRF Geo Chem databases, focusing on selectively retaining element compositions and item IDs for downstream analysis.

## How to Use: Tab-by-Tab Workflow

The application guides you through a sequential data processing workflow across four main tabs:

### 1. Raw Data üì•

This is your **initial loading and pre-filter stage**.
* **Load Data:** Use the input feature to upload your Geo Chem CSV file.
* **Initial Filtering:** Apply basic filters by **Sample Name** and the **Analysis Method** used to narrow down the dataset.

### 2. Subset Data üßº

This tab presents a **cleaned and refined dataset** ready for analysis.
* **Automatic Cleanup:** Only the essential `LAB_ID`s and element concentration columns are retained.
* **Processing Switches (Sidebar):** Use the switches in the sidebar to:
    * **Drop Zero Columns:** Automatically remove element columns where the sum of readings is 0 (i.e., elements that were not detected).
    * **Normalize Data:** Apply normalization to the remaining element readings for comparative analysis.
* **Manual Element Removal:** You can remove additional unwanted element columns by deselecting them from the **Input Selection** in the sidebar.

### 3. Analytics üìà

This is the **visualization and individual sample inspection** stage.
* **Individual Item Filtering:** Select individual `LAB_ID` items from the dropdown to view their specific readings and analytics.
* **Interactive Visualizations:** Review plots and tables showing the composition for the selected sample(s).

### 4. Summary & Export üíæ

This final tab aggregates your key findings and handles data output.
* **Aggregated Results:** Displays a summary of the `LAB_ID` items and their analytics that you selected and finalized in the **Analytics** tab.
* **Analytics Selection (Sidebar):** Choose the specific type of analytics (e.g., summary statistics, specific ratios) you wish to include in the final report via the **Input Select** tab in the sidebar.
* **Saving Data:** When the **Save** button is clicked, the application exports a compilation of:
    * The final, processed reading values.
    * The selected analytics results.
    * The original **Raw Data** table.
    * The cleaned **Subset Data** table.

# üå≥ Contribution & Versioning

This repository utilizes two main branches:

* **`master`:** This is the **stable branch** currently used for critical lab work. **Do not push directly to this branch.**
* **`experimental`:** Please push all new features, bug fixes, and development changes to the `experimental` branch. Pull requests will be reviewed and merged into `master` after validation.
